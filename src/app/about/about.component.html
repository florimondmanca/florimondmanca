  ## Bio

  Born in Belgium and naturalized French, I am a citizen of Europe. I pursue a Masters of Engineering with a focus on Software Engineering at [CentraleSup√©lec](http://www.centralesupelec.fr/en), France. I am a passionate problem solver. I try to feed my curiosity and learn everyday. I draw motivation from challenging problems, effective team collaboration and enriching relationships. I believe in user-first approaches. Systems should accomodate their users, not the other way around. I can be an idealist. I believe technology can help us solve the most urgent issues humanity is currently facing.

  ## Values

  I value strong work ethics. Here are some of the motos that drive my work.
